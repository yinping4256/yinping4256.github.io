<p>Professor Lin told us two interesting ideas he got in Sigmetrics.</p>

<p>First, CSMA/CA algorithm. Dr. Shin proved a logarithm backoff function when collision is detected can achieve throughput optimal.</p>

<p>Second, power of 2. In bins and balls algorithm, if randomly tossing N balls into N bins, the load will not be balanced. However, if tossing two dices which correspond two bins, and place the ball into the bin with fewer balls in it, then after doing this N times, the load will be much more balanced.</p>
